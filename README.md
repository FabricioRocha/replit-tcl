# replit-tcl
Tcl/tk snippets, integrated with Repl.it

## .replit for Tcl/Tk
Tcl support is new in Repl.it as of July 2020, and the language does not appear in some of the website comboboxes for creating a new Repl. Actually, the .replit file can have its _run_ setting value set either for _tclsh_ or _wish_. Running _wish_ will show a remote, tiny X window.

Anyway, the chosen interpreter will have to have one single .tcl file indicated to be run.
